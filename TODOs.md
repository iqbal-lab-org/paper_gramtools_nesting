Trees
=====

* Draw trees with the basal split node coloured, to relate the groups to the networks showing divergence
Thus probably produce the basal splits in plot_tree.R directly, deprecating the python script that does it.

Dependencies
============

Add the required r packages in the scripts that need them, perhaps as a call to biocManager::install / install.packages.
Or make an RScript installing all dependencies in one go, called by singu def file.
